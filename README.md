## I did use the Microsoft Copilot suggestions built into vscode for a a couple of sections when I was debugging. I used it in particular for the section of the summary data frame, I was getting errors until I saw that Copilot suggested resseting the index after I used the aggregate method. Also before using the aggregate function I asked Copilot how to use loc on a list of elements in a dataframe which is where I saw the isin method.
